# .# language docs

The `.#` is a non-Turing complete interpreted language built on top of Common Lisp.

Each program at the start of execution has field with `#` positioned in the center:
```
...........
...........
...........
...........
...........
.....#.....
...........
...........
...........
...........
...........
```

You can move `#` across the 11x11 field and that's virtually all you can do. If `#` crosses some boundary, it gets moved to the opposite side of the field (just like in the snake game).

## Available commands in `.#`:

### `up`
Moves the character by one position up.

### `down`
Moves the character by one position down.

### `left`
Moves the character by one position left.

### `right`
Guess what? Yeah, it moves the character by one position right, wow.

### `$`
Dollar sign denotes a line comment. Note that space is mandatory after the dollar sign.

### `show`
Prints current state of the field to stdout.

## Example
Programs can be run via command
```bash
clisp lang.cl code.txt
```
Consider the following program:
```
show
right
right
right
right
right
right

down
down
left
$ right
show
```
Expected output:
```
...........
...........
...........
...........
...........
.....#.....
...........
...........
...........
...........
...........

...........
...........
...........
...........
...........
...........
...........
..........#

```
That's it. You've mastered `.#`. You can now enjoy its wonderful features. Good luck on your route, `.#` programmer.
